# Linux Vagrant labs

I believe that best way to learn something is implementing if it is suitable.

These labs involve some advanced concepts, tools I learn over the years.

All servers in labs provisioned automatically by **bash** scripts.

I recommend you to setup your own lab and run commands manually step by step until you grasp things.

If you;
- think something is wrong or broken,
- have questions,
- want to share your own labs,
you are welcome to open PR's and submit issues.


If you are interested, I also have a repo for overlay network scenarios.
